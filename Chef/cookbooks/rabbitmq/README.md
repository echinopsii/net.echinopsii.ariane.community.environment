# rabbitmq Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jjasghar/rabbitmq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjasghar/rabbitmq)

This is a cookbook for managing RabbitMQ with Chef. It is intended for RabbitMQ 2.6.1 or later releases. With Chef we have adopted support >= 11.14.0 for chef-client, and leaning heavily on chef-client 12 and above.

## Requirements

This cookbook depends on the [erlang cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/erlang).

The release was tested with (rabbitmq.com/distro version), from the [kitchen.yml](.kitchen.cloud.yml).

- CentOS 6.5
- CentOS 7.0
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Debian 7.0

## Recipes

### default
Installs `rabbitmq-server` from RabbitMQ.com via direct download of the installation package or using the distribution version. Depending on your distribution, the provided version may be quite old so they are disabled by default. If you want to use the distro version, set the attribute `['rabbitmq']['use_distro_version']` to `true`. You may override the download URL attribute `['rabbitmq']['package']` if you wish to use a local mirror.

The cluster recipe is now combined with the default and will now auto-cluster. Set the `['rabbitmq']['cluster']` attribute to `true`, `['rabbitmq']['cluster_disk_nodes']` array of `node@host` strings that describe which you want to be disk nodes and then set an alphanumeric string for the `erlang_cookie`.

To enable SSL turn `ssl` to `true` and set the paths to your cacert, cert and key files.

#### Attributes

Default values and usage information of important attributes are shown below.  More attributes are documented in metadata.rb.

##### Username and Password

The default username and password are guest/guest:

`['rabbitmq']['default_user'] = 'guest'`

`['rabbitmq']['default_pass'] = 'guest'`

##### Loopback Users
By default, the guest user can only connect via localhost.  This is the behavior of RabbitMQ when the loopback_users configuration is not specified in it's configuration file.   Also, by default, this cookbook does not specify loopback_users in the configuration file:

`['rabbitmq']['loopback_users'] = nil`

If you wish to allow the default guest user to connect remotely, you can change this to `[]`. If instead you wanted to allow just the user 'foo' to connect over loopback, you would set this value to `["foo"]`.  More information can be found here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html.



### mgmt_console
Installs the `rabbitmq_management` and `rabbitmq_management_visualiser` plugins.
To use https connection to management console, turn `['rabbitmq']['web_console_ssl']` to true. The SSL port for web management console can be configured by setting attribute `['rabbitmq']['web_console_ssl_port']`, whose default value is 15671.

### plugin_management
Enables any plugins listed in the `node['rabbitmq']['enabled_plugins']` and disables any listed in `node['rabbitmq']['disabled_plugins']` attributes.

### community_plugins
Downloads, installs and enables pre-built community plugins binaries.

To specify a plugin, set the attribute `node['rabbitmq']['community_plugins']['PLUGIN_NAME']` to `'DOWNLOAD_URL'`. For example, to use the [RabbitMQ priority queue plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-priority-queue), set the attribute `node['rabbitmq']['community_plugins']['rabbitmq_priority_queue']` to `'https://www.rabbitmq.com/community-plugins/v3.4.x/rabbitmq_priority_queue-3.4.x-3431dc1e.ez'`.

### policy_management
Enables any policies listed in the `node['rabbitmq']['policies']` and disables any listed in `node['rabbitmq']['disabled_policies']` attributes.

### user_management
Enables any users listed in the `node['rabbitmq']['enabled_users']` and disables any listed in `node['rabbitmq']['disabled_users']` attributes.

### virtualhost_management
Enables any vhosts listed in the `node['rabbitmq']['virtualhosts']` and disables any listed in `node['rabbitmq']['disabled_virtualhosts']` attributes.


## Resources/Providers

There are 4 LWRPs for interacting with RabbitMQ.

### plugin
Enables or disables a rabbitmq plugin. Plugins are not supported for releases prior to 2.7.0.

- `:enable` enables a `plugin`
- `:disable` disables a `plugin`

#### Examples
```ruby
rabbitmq_plugin "rabbitmq_stomp" do
  action :enable
end
```

```ruby
rabbitmq_plugin "rabbitmq_shovel" do
  action :disable
end
```

### policy
sets or clears a rabbitmq policy.

- `:set` sets a `policy`
- `:clear` clears a `policy`
- `:list` lists `policy`s

#### Examples
```ruby
rabbitmq_policy "ha-all" do
  pattern "^(?!amq\\.).*"
  params ({"ha-mode"=>"all"})
  priority 1
  action :set
end
```

```ruby
rabbitmq_policy "ha-all" do
  action :clear
end
```

### user
Adds and deletes users, fairly simplistic permissions management.

- `:add` adds a `user` with a `password`
- `:delete` deletes a `user`
- `:set_permissions` sets the `permissions` for a `user`, `vhost` is optional
- `:clear_permissions` clears the permissions for a `user`
- `:set_tags` set the tags on a user
- `:clear_tags` clear any tags on a user
- `:change_password` set the `password` for a `user`

#### Examples
```ruby
rabbitmq_user "guest" do
  action :delete
end
```

```ruby
rabbitmq_user "nova" do
  password "sekret"
  action :add
end
```

```ruby
rabbitmq_user "nova" do
  vhost "/nova"
  permissions ".* .* .*"
  action :set_permissions
end
```

```ruby
rabbitmq_user "joe" do
  tag "admin,lead"
  action :set_tags
end
```

### vhost
Adds and deletes vhosts.

- `:add` adds a `vhost`
- `:delete` deletes a `vhost`

#### Examples
``` ruby
rabbitmq_vhost "/nova" do
  action :add
end
```


## Limitations

For an already running cluster, these actions still require manual intervention:
- changing the :erlang_cookie
- turning :cluster from true to false
